# CS-300

The problem we were solving in this course generally had to do with data structures and utilizing alogorithms to manipulate them efficiently. It also included ensuring the correct data type was used for efficiency in storage, access, and code efficiency. I approached the problem by considering how the application would need to access the data and calculating run-time. Since each data structure stores and accesses the data differently, I had to analyze the problem and choose the most efficient data type for that scenario. Zybooks was very helpful in showing how the structure of the algorithms worked. The biggest roadblock I encountered was the assignments were assigned using CSV files but none of the examples in the text used those functions or structure. I had to find alternate learning sources online to finish all of the work. My approach has been expanded by learning how to make orderly and reuasable code with algorithms. The work on this project has helped my structure and order for maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.
